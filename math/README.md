Calculus — to give you a background for other math classes and for application in areas such as analysis of algorithms.
Abstract algebra — relations, groups, etc. These are applicable to lots of different areas, e.g. Database, cryptography, etc.
Mathematical Logic — from Boolean algebra (for practical application in programming) through the predicate calculus (to understand the theoretical foundations of CS).
Graph theory — graphs… think about it.
Set theory — sets… obvious again.
Linear algebra — for applications
Number theory — especially if you are working in cryptography
Numerical methods — for applications
Probability and statistics — for Monte Carlo methods, data analysis, and a foundation for things like queuing theory
